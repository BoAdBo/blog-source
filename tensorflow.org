* pandas
  pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* Install CUDNNv6.0 onto CUDAv8.0
  Basically moving the *lib64* and *include* to */usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64-or-include*, Note not the symbolic link!!! Which is */usr/local/cuda/lib64-or-include*, that's not neccessarily cuda-8.0.
